        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting <em>places</em> on the way: 
       <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla,WA, </li>
        <li>Magic City, ID, </li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
        <li>Last Chance, 
            <ul>
                <li>iphone</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CO,</li>
        <li>Why,</li> 
        </ol>
        AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get
        you, A glimpse, Of eternity."<q> I definitely won't be passing
        any cars.</q>

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
        digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one Segway."
